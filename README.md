## Challenge and Approach

- People still drive despite the panoply of transit options available to people in seattle
- Cars are too still too convenient
- Finding trusted carpoolers is hard

How do we get cars off the road? 
- Easy to use mobile app
- Trusted carpoolers linked to well known companies
- Employees can find colleagues to carpool with

"It’s an amazingly well-organized event that is extremely efficient, saving fuel and time. We estimated that 25,000 people casual carpool in D.C. each day.  That takes a lot of cars off the road" - Mark Burris 
Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) Associate Research Engineer
